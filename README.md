## INSTRUCTIONS

Compile/Run in Release/x64.

Use WASDQE to move the camera. Hold left mouse button and move camera to rotate a bit (may be quite sensitive).

The simulation will play automatically. No input is required.

## BITMAPS

The program will attempt to load a file called resourceMap.bmp from the assets folder. I have provided one as an example. It is assumed that the map is organized in such a way that each node = 1 pixel. Warning: if an invalid pixel is included in the image, then the program will not work.
